# Carbon Footprint Calculator
## Overview
The Carbon Footprint Calculator is a user-friendly application designed to help individuals and households assess their environmental impact based on electricity consumption. By calculating the carbon emissions associated with their energy use, this tool empowers users to make informed decisions about their consumption habits and adopt more sustainable practices.

## Features
User Input:
Users can enter essential details such as customer ID, name, contact number, and electricity usage data for personalized calculations.
Data Validation:
The application includes robust validation mechanisms to ensure that user inputs are accurate. This includes checking that the contact number is a valid 10-digit number and that the units of energy consumed are non-negative.
Carbon Footprint Calculation:
The tool calculates total carbon emissions based on the user’s energy consumption using a fixed carbon emission factor (0.4 kg CO2 per kWh). This provides a clear understanding of how energy use translates into environmental impact.
Historical Comparison:
Users can compare their current month’s energy consumption with that of the previous month, enabling them to identify trends and changes in their usage patterns.
Informative Output:
Results are displayed in a clear and visually appealing format, making it easy for users to understand their consumption and its implications.
Personalized Recommendations:
Based on the calculated carbon footprint, the tool offers practical suggestions for reducing energy consumption, such as switching to energy-efficient appliances or exploring renewable energy options.
